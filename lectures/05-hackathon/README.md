## Welcome to Day 3!

Last day of the summer school already! Today you'll work on 2 notebook: a supervised learning one and then you'll work on building your own mini alert broker for ZTF.

### Supervised learning notebook
1. Follow [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PsbKYzMxmUFzGN4UFSQxfnYP2fofQHnj/view?usp=drive_link) to the dataset zip file.
Then, make a shortcut to this file in your own Google Drive by clicking the "Add shortcut to Drive" button (shown below) and placing it
wherever is convenient (just keep track of where you put it).

2. Follow [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UpXn5oCoPSvrUlg0e3eUE8D8RiG34axT?usp=sharing) to the notebook.
At the top, there are instructions for making a copy of the notebook and connecting the dataset to the Colab runtime.

### Mini Alert Broker using ZTF data and your own ML model
